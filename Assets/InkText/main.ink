/// Wake Up Scene
=== Beginning ===

It was December 1st, the time of year where people are daydreaming about the holidays and spending time with their loved ones.
However, all that my Chud ass was thinking about was how to get 150% on my final exam to pass my class.
So to temper the pain, I ended up doomscrolling through reels, here in my comfortable bed...
at 12 a.m.
"Uhhhhhhh... FMCL." #chc_Aldric #nm_Eldric
"That stands for fuck my chungus life, by the way." 
I snicker to myself in my empty room, talking to no one in particular. #nm_none
"GPT, what do I do with my life?" #nm_Eldric
Somehow I always end up on my favorite app and pastime, ChatGPT. #nm_none
"Hey, it seems that you are feeling down. Contact this number: 98..." #nm_ChatGPT
"Ahhhhh..." I sigh to myself. #nm_Eldric
Same response as always. #nm_none
Alright, I can't rot in this bed forever...
'Focus on making yourself feel excited, powerful.'
That's what a wise man once told me, I have to follow through.
Sliding out of my bed and leaving the protection of my blankie, I feel the crisp winter air assault my skin. #chl_Aldric
I have to power through as I begin my pilgrimage towards the bathroom. #chr_Aldric
... #ch_Aldric_Clear
To Be Continued... Or Not
End -> END
