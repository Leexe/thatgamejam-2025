/// Wake Up Scene
=== Beginning ===

It was December 1st. 
The season of jolly, where normal people daydream about cooling down and chilling with their loved ones.
Me? 
My chud ass was busy thinking about how I can achieve a 150% on my final exam, which was the bare minimum I needed to pass.
To numb the pain, I lay in bed, doomscrolling through Reels until my eyes burned...
It was 12:03 a.m.
"Uhhhhhhh... FMCL." #chc_clown #nm_Chud
"That stands for 'Fuck My Chungus Life', by the way." 
I snicker to myself in my empty room, talking to myself again. #nm_none
"GPT, what do I do with my life?" #nm_Chud
Naturally, I end up on my favorite app and dear friend, ChatGPT. #nm_none
"It appears you are experiencing distress. If you are in crisis, please contact 98..." #nm_ChatGPT
"Ughhh..." I groaned to myself. #nm_Chud
Same response as always. #nm_none
Alright, I can't rot in this bed forever...
'Focus on making yourself feel excited, powerful.'
That's what a wise man once told me.
I have to follow through.
Sliding out of my bed and leaving the protection of my blankie, I feel the crisp winter air assault my skin. #chl_clown_freaky
Powering through the arctic, I begin my pilgrimage towards the bathroom. #chr_clown

To Be Continued... Or Not
